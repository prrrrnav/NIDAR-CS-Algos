✅ Task Instructions for Everyone:
📁 Folder Setup
Create your own separate folder with the topic assigned to you.

Use a clear folder name related to your topic (e.g., signal-processing, fluid-mechanics, etc.).

🧩 Code Writing
Write your code in a modular way:

Use functions and separate logic into different files if needed.

Follow clean coding practices.

Keep your folder self-contained (it should not depend on other folders).

📝 Add a README.md Inside Your Folder
Include the following in your README:

📌 What your code does (a brief summary).

📥 Input format (what kind of input your code expects).

📤 Output format (what the code returns or shows).

❓ Doubts/Questions:

Mention any issues you're facing, bugs, or doubts about the problem statement or data.

Ask for help/clarification if needed — this is important especially for ECE/MECH topics where we may not have enough info.

📣 Communication
If you're stuck or need help, feel free to reach out directly:
