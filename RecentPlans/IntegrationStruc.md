🧩 INTEGRATION FLOW (Module by Module with Full Flow)
Let’s align with the flowchart you asked for earlier:

"Takeoff → Scan at Hover Points → Detect People → Save GPS → Go to Boundary → Drop 2 Loads → Return → Reload → Fly Again to Remaining Points → Finish"

🔶 1. camera_module/ — Detect Humans
🧠 Role: Detect people in the camera frame
📍Flow Stage: While drone is hovering/scanning
➡️ Inputs:

Live camera feed

Hover signal from mission_control

Drone’s orientation (optional)

⬅️ Outputs:

Detection list (with bounding boxes, angle, confidence)

Sent to lrf_module via shared object/queue

🧩 Integrates With:

lrf_module (to calculate distance)

gps_logger (after distance is known)

mission_control (sends detect_start/detect_stop flags)

🔶 2. lrf_module/ — Distance to Survivors
🧠 Role: Find how far survivors are from drone
📍Flow Stage: Immediately after camera detects someone
➡️ Inputs:

Detection angles from camera_module

Raw LRF distance data

⬅️ Outputs:

(x, y, z) offset of survivor

Sent to gps_logger for GPS conversion

🧩 Integrates With:

camera_module (match detected angle with LRF)

gps_logger (gives relative offset)

Needs drone_position from mavlink_comm

🔶 3. gps_logger/ — Save Survivor Location + Generate KML
🧠 Role: Convert position to GPS, store in CSV/KML
📍Flow Stage: After each survivor detection
➡️ Inputs:

Drone's current GPS (mavlink_comm)

Offset from LRF (x, y)

Detection metadata

⬅️ Outputs:

CSV entry (lat, lon, confidence, timestamp)

KML icon on map

Adds to global detection_list

🧩 Integrates With:

lrf_module for offsets

mavlink_comm for real GPS

drop_module and mission_control read detection_list

🔶 4. drop_module/ — Drop Aid + Load Count
🧠 Role: Drop payload to nearby survivor
📍Flow Stage: After reaching boundary or known survivor point
➡️ Inputs:

Drone's current location (mavlink_comm)

Target survivor GPS (detection_list)

Current load count

⬅️ Outputs:

Trigger drop (via GPIO or MAVLink SERVO command)

Update load count (load_count -= 1)

Mark that survivor as helped: true in detection list

🧩 Integrates With:

gps_logger (reads detection_list)

mission_control (receives signal for drop)

mavlink_comm (drone position)

🔶 5. mavlink_comm/ — Talk to Flight Controller + GCS
🧠 Role: Get drone telemetry & send data to GCS
📍Flow Stage: Throughout mission
➡️ Inputs:

Telemetry (position, altitude, speed)

Commands from Ground Control

⬅️ Outputs:

Current GPS to gps_logger and lrf_module

Survivor data uplink to GCS (optional)

Flight mode change (e.g., RTL)

Drop trigger (optional: send servo command)

🧩 Integrates With:

gps_logger, drop_module, mission_control (feeds drone position)

Optional: GCS web dashboard

🔶 6. mission_control/ — Orchestrator / Brain
🧠 Role: State machine to control all behavior
📍Flow Stage: Entire mission
➡️ Inputs:

Load count

detection_list

Drone’s GPS/altitude

Flags from all modules (e.g., detected, drop_complete)

⬅️ Outputs:

Start/stop scanning

Signal to drop

Command return to launchpad

Re-launch logic after reload

Change to next state: SCOUT → DROP → RETURN → REDO

🧩 Integrates With All Modules:

Runs all threads

Reads and modifies shared memory

Controls mission progress

🔄 DATA SHARING & SYNC
Use threading.Lock() or queue.Queue() to handle data between modules.
