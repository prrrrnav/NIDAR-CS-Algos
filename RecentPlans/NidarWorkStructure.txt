✅ What Is Done So Far (Based on ReadMEs + What You Told Me)
Module	Status	Summary
✅ GPS & KML Logging	✅ Completed	Logs GPS positions, creates .csv and .kml map for survivors
✅ Drop Module	✅ Completed	Drops load at location, updates JSON, handles load count
✅ Load Counter	✅ Completed	Manages count (starts with 2), stops if load = 0
🟡 Camera Module	🔄 In Progress	Human detection started (YOLO or webcam), might not be fully integrated with LRF or GPS yet
🟡 Multithreading	✅ Being Used	Threads exist in code, more refinement might be needed
🔴 LRF Distance Integration	❌ Not yet	Needs to be combined with camera to calculate survivor’s real-world GPS
🔴 Mission Flow Logic	❌ Not yet	Full logic for “scan → drop → return → reflight” not yet implemented
🔴 Communication with GCS	❌ Not yet	Need to set up MAVLink data sharing or survivor data uplink
🔴 Auto Reflight to Stored Points	❌ Not yet	After first 2 drops, drone should fly to saved survivor GPS and drop there

🧠 Team Breakdown (Recap of Roles + Progress)
You’ve split the work among 4 CSE people. Here’s a status view of who should be doing what:

👤 Person 1 – Human Detection + LRF + GPS Calculation
✅ YOLO or webcam detection started

❌ LRF distance + GPS triangulation not yet done

❌ Still needs to calculate real GPS of detected humans

📌 Priority: Finish integrating camera + LRF → GPS coordinate

👤 Person 2 – Data Logging + KML
✅ Already saving GPS + load info

✅ KML file generation working

✅ Task complete. Can help others now.

👤 Person 3 – MAVLink Communication with Ground Station
❌ Not implemented yet

Needs to:

Read drone GPS/altitude/attitude

Send survivor GPS to GCS

Receive new waypoint commands (optional)

📌 Priority: Setup MAVProxy or DroneKit script to send survivor list or mission data

👤 Person 4 – Mission Flow Controller (Main Brain)
❌ Not yet built

Needs to write:

Mission logic: Takeoff → scan → drop → return → reflight

Use load status + location file to make decisions

Coordinate with Drop + GPS + Camera threads

📌 Priority: Implement mission state machine

📊 Progress Summary Chart
Area	Status
Camera Detection	🟡 70%
LRF + GPS	🔴 0%
KML Mapping	✅ 100%
Load Management	✅ 100%
Drop Trigger	✅ 100%
Multithreading	🟡 70%
Ground Station Comm	🔴 0%
Full Mission Logic	🔴 0%



✅ Final Thoughts
You're at 60–65% done from CSE side. Once:

Camera + LRF → GPS is working,

Mission flow is coded,

GCS receives survivor data,

you’ll have a full autonomous scouting-delivery system ready.
